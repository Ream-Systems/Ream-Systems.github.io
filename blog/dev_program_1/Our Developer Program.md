# Ream Developer Program #

### What is it and why you should you care? ###

<br> The idea of the developer program is to set up a network of connections between developers across Scotland. <br>

It will give companies a way to seach for talented, up-and-coming developers who have the perfect skillset that they need; it will provide the links required to gather together teams of like-minded people; and it will give you the oportunity to get your foot in the door at the companies or startups that you dream of working for!<br><br><br>

### Node and Deno hosting ###

As discussed in our previous blog post, as part of our developer program we plan to provide an easy-to-use api for you to host your own Node or Deno projects.
You will only be paying for the resources you actually use. At the end of each month we will tally up the percentage resource usage of your projects per day. We will only charge you for the cost of the electricity used to run our servers, plus a small percent to run our internet connection, at a very minimal markup. <br><br>

We will give you a variety of ways of interacting with our node hosting api, allowing you to push and run your projects directly to our systems, in a safe sandboxed enviroment. This includes: a command line tool, a website that has a console for you to use, a desktop app or any other way you want to interact with our api! <br><br>

Why are we doing this? We know how irritating and expensive it is to use third-party hosting services, and we want to make it as simple and as flexible as possible. We are going to be running our servers, regardless of whether they will be used to their full capacity. This way we can offset the costs of running our servers, and give you a cheap and easy way to host your projects. It benefits everyone! <br><br>


### Our plans for the developer program ###

Obviously all of this is still in it's very early stages, but in future we plan to start reaching out to companies and organisations who might be interested in this scheme.<br><br>

We also plan to create a website that (as mentioned in the intro) allows companies or teams to search for developers with the correct skillsets that they need - focusing less on academic achievement and more on the personal projects and past work experience that show off their initiative and ingenuity. <br><br>

We want to represent our community. We will happily contact any company that you wish to apply for in an official capacity and advertise you as an idividual. Not only will this benefit you as a way to impress and intrigue any potential employer, but it will help us spread our network of connections further afield in the world at large. <br><br>
