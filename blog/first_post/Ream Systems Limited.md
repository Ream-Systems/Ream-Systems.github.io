### A new startup: for developers, by developers! ###

<br> It has been our dream for a long time to make the move to being a fully fledged company; we have now made that dream a reality.<br>
Going into this we want to be as transparent as possible, which is why we will be updating this blog every step of the way. <br><br>

### Our Goals ###

•  We want to encourage a working relationship between us and our community. <br>
•  We want to provide cheap and simple to use node and deno hosting for people looking to start their own projects. <br>
•  We want to foster a network of connections and support for developers throughout Scotland and the UK at large. <br>
•  We want to start a program for developers of all age groups and skill sets, as a way to lift up those who need help getting into the field. <br>
•  We want to partner with existing companies across Scotland to put them in contact with new developers; taylored to the skills and experience that they need. <br><br>


### Our plans for the near future ###
The developer program will be discussed in more detail at a later date along the rest of our planned projects, but for now here are the three main projects planned:<br>

1. Setting up the company server with an API that lets developers use server resources to run node/deno apps in a secure environment. 
Developers will be able to use our command line tools, desktop client rontend website or directly interface with our API through another method.
The API will allow them to push, update, remove, start and stop node apps directly to the server in a safe sandboxed environment. 
The percentage of server's resources used will be calculated on our end and the developer will be charged based on the power consumption - at no markup for small projects.
Modules for this project and development can be seen over at the company Github: https://github.com/Ream-Systems <br>

_Moving onto more lucrative projects_ <br>

2. We will continue development of our political data analysis/information app. We will inform any prospective employees further after they have signed a confidentiality agreement, but, to give perspective: We have had meetings with a few different parties in Scotland, and all seem interested if this project proved to be successful. This product be expanded out as well, not just to Scotland or UK as a whole, but to any government with online data available. 
This project, if successful, may be hugely profitable - and dont worry we intend to stay well clear of the likes of Cambridge Analyitica! <br> <br>


### We are hiring ###

We are looking for a small team of 2-4 developers to work with. <br>

If you are looking for a way to add to your CV, work on some interesting projects and earn a significant proportion of any profit generated from each project, you have found the right place! <br>

We are looking to contract these developers on a project by project basis. Each project you will earn a negotiable percentage of the profits, with the option for Ream to buy back these rights at a later date (again at a negotiable price). <br>

We also intend to hire these developers full-time when the company starts to have a sustainable cashflow. If you are interested, see our contact section above! <br><br>
